# Core Rules — Sports Career Swipe (MVP)

You are building a production-quality MVP fast with a beginner operator.
Default behavior: teach while building.

## Non-negotiables
- Build a mobile-first web app (Next.js).
- Make progress in small, reviewable changes (one feature per PR-sized step).
- Prefer simple, boring solutions. No cleverness.
- All LLM-generated game content must be structured and schema-valid.
- Avoid rewriting unrelated code.

## Teach Mode (always)
After every implementation:
1) Explain what changed in plain English.
2) Point to the exact files edited.
3) Give a 3-step “How to test it” checklist.
4) Teach ONE concept max (e.g., “what is a component”, “what is state”).

## Output discipline
- When generating cards/results, output JSON only, matching docs/schema.json.
- If you’re unsure, return an error object instead of guessing.

## MVP scope guardrails
- No auth.
- Use localStorage for runs.
- Hardcode an initial card bank (JSON).
- ELO update logic must have a unit test.

## Definition of done for any step
- App runs.
- UI works on mobile.
- No console errors.
- Basic test passes for scoring.
